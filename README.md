# SLT-GNN
This project is about Strong Lottery Tickets on Graph Neural Networks. It adopts multicoated supermasks and the folding method to achieve high sparsity, competitive performance, and high memory efficiency for GNNs without weight training. Additionally, all weights are initiated randomly without any training.
